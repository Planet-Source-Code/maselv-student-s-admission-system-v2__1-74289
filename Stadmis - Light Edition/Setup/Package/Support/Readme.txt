GETTING STARTED
-------------------
In order to have all the neccessary files for successful running of this Stadmis Software, I have changed the extensions of all exe files in the zip file. Please rename by replacing ' (changes ext to exe)' an extension '.exe' to those files. Most computers don't have neccessary ocx for the running of this Software. Therefore, in the Setup folder, add extension to 'Stadmis Setup (changes ext to exe)' file and run it. This will install an earlier version of Stadmis. Just use it to install all the ocx the software requires. The Setup password is 'Admin..'

After installation, run the file 'Stadmis Database Connector.udl'. On the 'Provider' tab, double-click on 'Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider' choice. The 'Connection' tab will be displayed. On option 1, there is a browse button. Click on it and browse for the Software's database 'Stadmis Database.mdb' {Located on the Software folder}. A password error will occur when you click on 'Test Connection'. Just click on OK to save and exit.

Run the software; you can use the vb6 file or Stadmis.exe file.

Since it is the first time the Software is running on the computer, it will request for unlock code. I have attached the unlock code generator exe. Change it extension and run. Select the date in correspondence with the computer's date. Click on 'Generate Unlock Code'. The code will be generated and saved on the Clipboard ready for pasting. Paste the code on the Software's Unlock Code request form and click on OK to proceed. I developed Stadmis Software in such a way that when first run on any machine it requests for the unlock code, which sets it to trial version running for 31 days. I programmed the unlock code in such a way that each day as its own code as follows:

The software will then request for the database's password, which is:-

28331162973100310931053115246246

After typing it, select the 'Decrypt' option and then click on OK button. A login Form will be displayed. The Logon credentials are:-

Username: Admin
Password: Blank

Once the trial period is over, the Software will request for a serial code. This consists of 25 letters grouped in a set of 5 i.e. ABCDE-FGHIJ-KLMNO-PQRST-UVWXY. The serial code defines the Software's:-

1. Serial Code
2. Serial key
3. Licence Code
4. Expiry date
5. Max No of Users created in the software

This serial code provided is unique for every computer that the software runs on. Therefore, it cannot work on any other machine by virtue of copy pasting. The serial key is programmatically generated and is unique for every machine too. The License Code ensures that the supplied Serial Code can only work on the day of the week it was generated for. By use of the Keygen, a serial code can be provided that alters any of these details. If a fake Serial credential is detected by the software, the license is revoked, and new credentials are regenerated.
